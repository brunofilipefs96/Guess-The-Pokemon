# Guess-The-Pokemon

This is a simple web-based guessing game where the user has to guess the names of all 151 original Pokémon.

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: The goal of the game is to guess the names of all 151 original Pokémon correctly.

2. **Guessing**: The player will be presented with an image of a Pokémon and a set of dropdown menus containing letters. The player has to select the letters to form the correct name of the Pokémon.

3. **Scoring**: Each correct guess earns the player a point. The game ends when the player correctly guesses all 151 Pokémon.

4. **Lives**: The player starts with three lives. Making an incorrect guess deducts one life. If the player runs out of lives, the game ends.

5. **Try Again**: If the player successfully guesses all 151 Pokémon or runs out of lives, they can click the "Try Again" button to restart the game.
